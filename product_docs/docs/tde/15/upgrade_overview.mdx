EDB supports using [pg_upgrade](/tde/latest/pg_upgrade_arguments/) to add encryption to unencrypted systems. 
This table provides an overview of supported use cases: 

| Use case                           | Source unencrypted server                     | Target encrypted server                                            |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Perform a minor upgrade            | Unencrypted EDB Postgres Extended Server 16.1 | Encrypted EDB Postgres Extended Server 16.2                        |
| Change the Postgres distribution   | Unencrypted PostgreSQL 16                     | Encrypted EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16                          |
| Maintain the Postgres distribution | Unencrypted EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15   | Encrypted EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15                          |
| Maintain the Postgres distribution | Encrypted EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15     | Encrypted EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15 with new encryption keys |

!!! ImportantImportant
    Both source and target servers must be in the same Postgres major version. `pg_upgrade` only supports upgrades between minor versions.

## Overview 

To enable encryption:

1. Perform a backup of your system. 
1. Install the target Postgres version. 
1. Initialize a new server with TDE enabled. 
1. Use `pg_upgrade` with the `--copy-by-block` option to upgrade to a TDE system.
