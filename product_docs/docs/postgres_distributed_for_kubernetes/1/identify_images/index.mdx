If you plan on deploying a specific version of Postgres Distributed or a specific Postgres distribution or version, you will need to select the appropriate images and image versions.
Before [installing EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/installation_upgrade):

1.  Identify your repository name and retrieve your user token as explained in [EDB private image registries](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/private_registries/).
- [Identify the image names for your environment](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/identify_images/identify_image_name).
- [Assemble your deployment command](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/identify_images/assemble_command).
