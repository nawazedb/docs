1.  Identify your repository name and retrieve your user token as explained in [EDB private image registries](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/private_registries/).
1.  [Identify the image names for your environment](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/identify_images/identify_image_name).
1.  [Assemble your deployment command](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/identify_images/assemble_command).
