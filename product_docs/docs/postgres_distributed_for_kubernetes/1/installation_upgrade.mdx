You can deploy EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes using the provided
[Helm chart](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts).

!!! Info
    For more details on the Helm chart, see the
    [Helm chart repo documentation](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts).

These installation instructions cover using `helm` to deploy of a set of default images with the latest available version. 
If want to specify a different operand or proxy image, see 
[Identify your installation images and repositories](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/identify_images/) 
before continuing with the installation. 

## Prerequisites

- Install [Helm](https://helm.sh). Follow these [instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) to install it
  in your system.

- Install `kubectl`. See [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) 
  for intructions.

- Create at least one Kubernetes cluster.

## Add the repository 

Use `helm` to add the repository containing all images:

```console
helm repo add edb \
  https://enterprisedb.github.io/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts/
```

## Deploy the images

!!! Important
    You need access to the private EDB repository where both the operator
    and operand images are stored. Access requires a valid
    [EDB subscription plan](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/plans-comparison).
    
    To identify your access credentials, see [Accessing EDB private image registries](private_registries.md).

Given that the container images for both the operator and the selected operand
are in EDB's private registry, you need your credentials to enable `helm` to
retrieve them.

Make sure to replace your repo and token in the following command:

```console
helm upgrade --dependency-update \
  --install edb-pg4k-pgd \
  --wait \
  --namespace pgd-operator-system \
  --create-namespace \
  edb/edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes \
  --set image.imageCredentials.username=<repository_name> \
  --set image.imageCredentials.password=<your_repository_token>
```

In particular:

-   Set `<repository_name>` to the name of the repository, as explained in [Which repository to
    choose?](private_registries.md#which-repository-to-choose).
-   Set `<your_repository_token>` to the repository token for your EDB account, as explained in
    [How to retrieve the token](private_registries.md#how-to-retrieve-the-token).

## Create a certificate issuer

Be sure to create a cert issuer before you start deploying PGD clusters.
The Helm chart prompts you to do this, but in case you miss it,
you can, for example, run:

```sh
kubectl apply -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts/main/hack/samples/issuer-selfsigned.yaml
```

With the operators and a self-signed cert issuer deployed, you can start
creating PGD clusters. See the
[Quick start](quickstart.md#part-3---deploy-a-pgd-cluster) for an example.


## Red Hat OpenShift

If you're trying to install EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes on Red Hat OpenShift,
see [Red Hat OpenShift](openshift.md), which contains
information on the certified operator maintained by EDB.
