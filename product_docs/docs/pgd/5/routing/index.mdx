Managing application connections is an important part of high availability.

Especially with asynchronous replication, having a consistent write lead node is
important to avoid conflicts and guarantee availability for the
application.

EDB Postgres Distributed provides a proxy layer called PGD Proxy, which is
normally installed in highly available configuration (at least two instances per
region).

The PGD Proxy connects to one of the EDB Postgres Distributed nodes and monitors
routing configuration changes as decided by the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.
It ensures that the connections are routed to the correct nodes consistently.

The information about currently selected write and read nodes is visible in
`bdr.node_group_routing_summary`. Note that this is node-local view, the proxy
always reads from Raft leader to get current and consistent view.

## Leader selection

The write leader is selected by the current Raft leader (either group one or global one,
depending on whether the leader for local group or global cluster is being selected).

Leader is selected from candidate nodes which are reachable and meet the criteria based
on the configuration as described bellow. To be a viable candidate, node has to have
`route_writes` enabled and `route_fence` disabled and be within `route_writer_max_lag`
(if enabled) from previous leader. The candidates are ordered by their `route_priority`
in descending order and by the lag from previous leader in ascending order.

New leader selection process is started when there is either no existing leader currently
(this could be because there were no valid candidates or because Raft was down), or when
connectivity is lost to the existing leader.

A Node is considered connected if the last Raft protocol message received from by the leader
it is not older than Raft election timeout
(see [Internal settings - Raft timeouts](../pgd-settings#internal-settings---raft-timeouts) ).

Since the Raft leader is sending heartbeat 3 times every election timeout limit, the leader
node needs to miss reply to 3 heartbeats before it's considered disconnected.

## Configuration

Configuring the routing is done through either SQL interfaces or through
PGD-CLI.

You can enable routing decisions by calling the `bdr.alter_node_group_option()` function.
For example:

```text
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option('region1-group', 'enable_proxy_routing', 'true')
```

You can disable it by setting the same option to `false`.

Additional group-level options affect the routing decisions:

- `route_writer_max_lag` &mdash; Maximum lag in bytes of the new write candidate to be
  selected as write leader. If no candidate passes this, no writer is
  selected automatically.
- `route_reader_max_lag` &mdash; Maximum lag in bytes for a node to be considered a viable
  read-only node. Currently reserved for future use.

Per-node configuration of routing is set using `bdr.alter_node_option()`. The
available options that affect routing are the following:

- `route_dsn` &mdash; The dsn used by proxy to connect to this node.
- `route_priority` &mdash; Relative routing priority of the node against other nodes in
  the same node group.
- `route_fence` &mdash; Whether the node is fenced from routing, that is, it can't receive connections
  from PGD Proxy.
- `route_writes` &mdash; Whether writes can be routed to this node, that is, whether the node
  can become write leader.
- `route_reads` &mdash; Whether read-only connections can be routed to this node. Currently
  reserved for future use.

You can also configure the proxies using SQL interfaces. You can add proxy configuration
using `bdr.create_proxy`. For example, `SELECT bdr.create_proxy('region1-proxy1', 'region1-group');`
adds the default configuration for a proxy named `region1-proxy1` that's a member
of PGD group `region1-group`. The name of the proxy given here must be same
as the name given in the proxy configuration file. You can remove a proxy configuration
using `SELECT bdr.drop_proxy('region1-proxy1')`. The proxy is
deactivated as a result.

You can configure options for each proxy using the `bdr.alter_proxy_option()` function.
The available options are:

- `listen_address` &mdash; Address for the proxy to listen on.
- `listen_port` &mdash; Port for the proxy to listen on.
- `max_client_conn` &mdash; Maximum number of connections for the proxy to accept.
- `max_server_conn` &mdash; Maximum number of connections the proxy can make to the
  Postgres node.
- `server_conn_timeout` &mdash; Connection timeout for server connections.
- `server_conn_keepalive` &mdash; Keepalive interval for server connections.
- `consensus_grace_period` &mdash; Duration for which proxy continues to route even upon loss
of a Raft leader. If set to `0s`, proxy stops routing immediately.

The current configuration of every group is visible in the
`bdr.node_group_routing_config_summary` view. Similarly, the
`bdr.node_routing_config_summary` view shows current per-node routing
configuration. `bdr.proxy_config_summary` shows per-proxy configuration.

You can also do a switchover operation to explicitly change the node that's
the write leader. To do so, use the `bdr.routing_leadership_transfer()` function.
